## Summary

Ever seen someone sell 16,000 festival tickets with zero advertising budget?
That was me. In Rabbit ears.

But here's the real story: Those people still message me 10 years later.

I build communities people never forget. The kind that turn $3K into $35K because members become evangelists, not just users.

**My path:**
- 🇷🇺 **Russia:** Created 60,000+ unforgettable moments across 200+ events
- 🔥 **Burning Man:** 4 years learning why Silicon Valley craves real connection
- 🇺🇸 **USA:** Now helping tech companies (recent: 11x ROI, 1000 attendees in 7 days)

The difference? I understand *why* people gather, not just *how* to gather them.
Mix that with AI automation and behavioral psychology = communities that scale.

**Tech companies come to me when:**
- Their events feel like obligations, not celebrations
- Their community strategy is just Slack channels
- They're tired of paying for every single user

Built 350K monthly visitors platform. Generated 6300+ earned media mentions across all projects.

Currently in SF, helping tech brands create movements, not just metrics.
